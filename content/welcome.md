# Welcome to The Purrtotype Lab

This is a living notebook where I collect experiments, reflections, and tiny wins. Each entry is just a Markdown file inside the content/ folder, so shipping new pages feels like writing in a journal.

## What you can expect

- Quick notes on small AI apps I build while learning
- Travel photo diaries with highlights and resources
- Cozy cat moments, Lego builds, and other hobbies that recharge me

## How it works

1. Create a Markdown file like content/my-new-note.md.
2. Add a # heading for the title and whatever sections you like.
3. The site automatically turns it into a page at /notes/my-new-note and lists it on the Notes page.

Happy tinkering!
